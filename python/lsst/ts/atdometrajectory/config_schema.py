      max_delta_azimuth:
        type: number
        description: ->
          Maximum difference between dome and telescope azimuth before moving the dome (deg).
          Set to the largest value that reliably avoids vignetting.
    required:
    - max_delta_azimuth
    additionalProperties: false
  azimuth_vignette_min:
    description: >-
      Azimuth angle difference (deg) above which the telescope is partially vignetted
      when the telescope is at elevation 0 (horizon). This is approximately 10째.
    type: number
  azimuth_vignette_max:
    description: >-
      Azimuth angle difference (deg) above which the telescope is fully vignetted
      when the telescope is at elevation 0 (horizon). This is approximately 25째
    type: number
  dropout_door_vignette_min:
    description: >-
      Elevation angle (deg) below which the telescope is partially vignetted
      by the dropout door, if that is closed and the main door is open.
      This is approximately 27째.
    type: number
  dropout_door_vignette_max:
    description: >-
      Elevation angle (deg) below which the telescope is fully vignetted
      by the dropout door, if that is closed and the main door is open.
      This is approximately 12째.
    type: number
  dome_inner_radius:
    description: >-
      Distance (mm) from the center of the telescope (intersection of elevation and azimuth axes)
      to the inner edge of the shutter (with the shutter doors both open).
      This is approximately the inner radius of the dome, which is 4648 mm (183").
      Used to compute vignetting by azimuth mismatch when the telescope elevation is non-zero.
  telescope_height_offset:
    description: >-
      Height (mm) of the center of the telescope (intersection of elevation and azimuth axes)
      above the center of radius of the dome. This is approximately 940 mm (37").
      Used to compute vignetting by azimuth mismatch when the telescope elevation is non-zero.
